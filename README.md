## 🧪 RegExp Console-Based Data Validation Project

This is a simple Python console application that uses **regular expressions (RegEx)** to validate and process user input. It demonstrates basic pattern matching and input sanitation techniques, commonly used in data entry and form validation systems.

### 🔍 Features

- ✅ **Name Validation**  
  Ensures only alphabetic characters and spaces are accepted.

- 📅 **Date of Birth Validation**  
  Accepts date input in `dd-mm-yyyy` format and converts it to `dd-mon-yyyy`.

- 📧 **Email Validation**  
  Validates Gmail addresses only (e.g., `example@gmail.com`).

- 📱 **Mobile Number Validation**  
  Accepts mobile numbers in `xxx-xxx-xxxx` format and converts them to a continuous digit string.

- 🔄 **Data Transformation**  
  - Converts the mobile number to digits only.
  - Transforms numeric months in the DOB into abbreviated names (e.g., `04` to `apr`).
